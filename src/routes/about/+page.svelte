			As a long-time viewer/listener of The Basement Yard podcast I have been looking for an
			opportunity to give back to the community that has arisen around one of the most entertaining
			shows on the internet. And I have heard the idea thrown around a couple times before of
			playing The Basement Yard Bingo, but didn't decide to act on it until the section below for
			their August 12th, 2024, podcast below:

		<div class="my-12 aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
			<iframe
				class="self-center"
				width="560"
				height="315"
				src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9SsDIPqDSU?si=PpapPApn9qLuvMw0&amp;start=710"
				title="YouTube video player"
				frameborder="0"
				allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
				referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
				allowfullscreen
			></iframe>
		</div>
		<p class="py-2 text-center text-justify">
			So, I created this custom website take suggestions from the video, the comments, and other
			places (which I will credit below) to populate the board with new and updated references for
			the show. This website can be dynamically populated to grow with the show and powered by the
			awesome community they have garnered. Speaking of which I got many of the board moments from
			other amazing and talented members of the community before me like:

				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="py-2 text-center text-justify">
			And many of the comments from that video above. I plan to setup a form of some sort to accept
			new suggestions when/if the app gets used by anyone else. And I hope people have as much fun
			using it as I have had making it!
